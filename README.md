# OU_Enrollment_Retention_Analysis
This project involves analyzing student enrollment and graduation data from the University of Oklahoma using SQL and visualizing the results in Tableau. The goal is to uncover trends in enrollment, retention rates, and graduation outcomes based on demographic factors.

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing student enrollment and graduation data from the University of Oklahoma using SQL and visualizing the results in Tableau. The goal is to uncover trends in enrollment, retention rates, and graduation outcomes based on demographic factors.

## Description
The primary goals are to:

- Retrieve and clean the data to prepare it for analysis.
- Examine trends in student enrollment, retention rates, and graduation outcomes.
- Investigate correlations between demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity with academic success.

The findings from these analyses provide valuable insights into student behaviors and institutional performance. By identifying key factors influencing retention and graduation rates, this project informs institutional strategies aimed at improving student success.

## Methodology
1. **Data Retrieval and Cleaning**: Using SQL, data is extracted from the higher education database, transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy, and prepared for further analysis.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Employing statistical techniques to explore trends in enrollment and graduation rates over time.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating relationships between demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity) and academic outcomes.
4. **Visualization**: The results are visualized using Tableau. Interactive dashboards and charts are created to illustrate key findings, such as retention rates, graduation trends, and demographic correlations, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Tools Used
- **SQL** for data retrieval and cleaning.
- **Tableau** for data visualization and creating dashboards to showcase trends and insights.

## Objectives
- To uncover actionable insights into factors influencing student retention and graduation rates.
- To visualize these insights in a clear and accessible way to support institutional strategies.
- To provide a comprehensive understanding of demographic impacts on student success.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Follow the setup instructions in the README for setting up SQL queries and connecting to the database.
- Explore the SQL scripts to understand how data is retrieved and transformed.
- Open the provided Tableau files to view and interact with the visualizations.
- Modify the SQL queries and Tableau dashboards as needed to adapt the project to different datasets or analyses.
